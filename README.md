This repo contains tools for logging and configuring with the Anello A-1.

This is main branch which works for the most common A1 configuration. You should probably use this branch unless you asked for the higher rate configuration. The regular configuration has ASCII outputs such as #APIMU, #APINS, #APGPS. If your unit is configured with high rate binary outputs, use the high_rate_binary branch instead.

    - Troubleshooting numpy / matplotlib issue in Linux:
        - on Raspberry Pi running Linux, the versions of matplotlib and numpy installed with pip did not work
        - To fix this, do:
            - pip install cutie
            - pip install pyserial
            - sudo apt install matplotlib
            - sudo apt install numpy
        - or if you already installed requirements.txt, do:
            - pip uninstall matplotlib
            - pip uninstall numpy
            - sudo apt install matplotlib
            - sudo apt install numpy
